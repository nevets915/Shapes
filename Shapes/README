-- You should not need to add member functions in the provided header files; 
   you definitely should NOT remove or modify any of the function prototypes.

-- The "shape" constructors that take an istream are used by ShapeFactory.
   A ShapeFactory object is typically used to read shapes saved in a file. 
   However, you may find it useful to use such an object to read the "c"
   commands the user types.  For example, the writeup has:

   >  c rectangle (2,-3) (4,-5)

   Note that the data after the "c" is basically what a ShapeFactory expects.
   But since the user can type in invalid data, the "shape" constructors
   need to do error-checking & throw an exception on error.
